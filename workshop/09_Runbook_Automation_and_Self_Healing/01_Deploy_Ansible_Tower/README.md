# Deploy Ansible Tower


In this lab we are going to deploy Ansible Tower, our chosen tool for automation, inside our cluster. Therefore, you will find a couple of files prepared in your home directory.

## Deploy manifests

1. Navigate to the manifest directory for Ansible Tower
    ```
    $ cd ~/manifests-ansible-tower
    ```

1. Create the resources with the following commands.
    ```
    $ kubectl create -f ns.yml
    $ kubectl create -f dep.yml
    $ kubectl create -f svc.yml
    ```
    This will create a new namespace `tower`, a deployment, as well as a service called `ansible-tower`. 

1. Retrieve the public (external) IP of your Ansible Tower installation.
    ```
    $ kubectl get svc -n tower

    Output
    NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)         AGE
    ansible-tower   LoadBalancer   XX.XX.XXX.XXX   XX.XXX.XXX.XXX   443:32096/TCP   18m
    ```

1. Open your favourite browser and navigate to `https://external-ip` (please note the _https_). You login credentials are:
    - Username: admin
    - Password: dynatrace

1. Submit the Ansible Tower license when prompted.
